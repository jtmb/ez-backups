### <h1>About</h1>

An Alpine-based microservice within Docker, designed to make backups easy.

This solution proves invaluable for those who self-host - allowing for easy automated backups to multiple locations.

### Highlighted Features:

- <b>Multiple backup locations! </b>Backup between cloud, local or both! 
- <b>Sync backups</b> back up to 3 locations at the same time!
- <b>User-friendly customization</b> achieved through a concise set of environment variables.
- <b>Integration with Discord</b> for simple alert notifications.
- <b>Fast</b> - API request total time on average is less than a second.
- <b>Lightweight</b> - Alpine Container keeps the image size below 15 MB.
- <b>Scalable</b> - Built with scale in mind, Docker Swarm compatible.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system

### <h2>Getting Started</h2>
### [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtmb92/ez-backups)
```docker
 docker pull jtmb92/ez-backups
```

### Running on docker
A simple docker run command gets your instance running.
```shell
docker run --name ez-backups \
        -e scheduled_hour: '15'
        -e scheduled_minute: '59'
        -e WEBHOOK_URL: 'your-discord-webhook'
        -e local_backup_method: rsync
        -e source_dir: '/test/test1 /test/test2 /test/test3'
        -e backup_destination: /test/test4
        -e TZ: America/New_York
jtmb92/ez-backups
```
### Running on docker-compose
Run on Docker Compose (this is the recommended way) by running the command "docker compose up -d".
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
    ez-backups:
        image: jtmb92/ez-backups
        container_name: ez-backups
        volumes:
         - /test:/test
        environment:
            scheduled_hour: '15'
            scheduled_minute: '59'
            WEBHOOK_URL: 'your-discord-webhook'
            local_backup_method: tar
            source_dir: '/test/test1 /test/test2 /test/test3'
            backup_destination: /test/test4
            TZ: America/New_York
```

### Backing up to remote locations
Backing up to remote locations now supported! 
Example of a remote backup to rsyncnet, using ssh keys:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  ez-backups:
    image: jtmb92/ez-backups:latest
    environment:
      scheduled_hour: '00'
      scheduled_minute: '12'
      WEBHOOK_URL: "${discord_webhook}"
      local_backup_method: tar
      remote_backup_method: rsync
      remote_host: ${rsync_net_user}.rsync.net
      remote_user: ${rsync_net_user}
      private_key_name: id_rsa_rsyncNet
      source_dir: '${container_volumes_location}'
      backup_destination: /test/test4
      TZ: America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ${container_volumes_location}:${container_volumes_location}
      - ${container_volumes_location}/ez-backups/.ssh:/.ssh
      - /test/test4:/test/test4
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
      placement:
        max_replicas_per_node: 1
    logging:
      driver: loki
      options:
        loki-url: "http://localhost:3003/loki/api/v1/push"
        loki-retries: "5"
        loki-batch-size: "400"
networks:
  container-swarm-network:
    external: true
```

### Performing an adhoc (one time) backup
Sometimes you may need to run a backup just once. You can do so by specifying the backup method with the "ezbackups" command:
```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME ezbackups local_backup_method=tar

```
and for remote:
```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME ezbackups remote_backup_method=rsyncnet

```
## Environment Variables explained

    scheduled_hour: '5'
```
